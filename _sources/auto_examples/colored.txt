Image-colored wordcloud
========================
You can color a word-cloud by using an image-based coloring strategy implemented in
ImageColorGenerator. It uses the average color of the region occupied by the word
in a source image. You can combine this with masking - pure-white will be interpreted
as 'don't occupy' by the WordCloud object when passed as mask.
If you want white as a legal color, you can just pass a different image to "mask",
but make sure the image shapes line up.
